This project was created over the course of 2.5 weeks as part of the <a href='https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/dc'>Flatiron School Data Science Fellowship in DC<a/>. This project is part of a longer-term goal to explore whether we can use machine learning approaches to predict the spread of wildfires. 

**--Project Status: [Active]**

## Project Goal

Can we apply machine learning techniques to predict where wildfires are most likely to spread? This project explores a subset of that question: for one point in time (December 22, 2019), can we use weather data to identify active fires, burned areas, land (other), and water in Australia?
