   "source": [
    "First, I developed a labeled dataset covering the time period and geography of interest. I used Google Earth Engine to download several satellite data products from NASA and JAXA, and used several geospatial and scientific Python packages to transform them into a labeled dataset consisting of four labels: active fire, burned area, land, and water. \n",
    "\n",
    "I scaled the data and applied methods to balance the classes. I randomly split the data into training (80% of the data) and test (20% of the data) sets, stratifying by labels. I then used ski-kit learn's multiclass classification algorithms to run logistic regression and random forest models on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I evaluated the model metrics (optimizing by balanced accuracy score) on both training and test data. After selecting the best-performing model, I ran the model on the entire dataset to visualize the mapped predictions compared to the actual predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty of room for improvement, particularly around feature selection, feature engineering, and modeling (including hyperparameter tuning). I summarized my thoughts on next steps in the final section of this notebook. "

    "\n",
    "My choice of data sources were informed by several factors.\n",
    "1) **Literature review**<br>\n",
    "In addition to several other articles on wildfire modeling, I was also inspired by the Canadian Fire Weather Index--for which a global monthly database is available <a href='https://data.giss.nasa.gov/impacts/gfwed/'>here</a>. The index calculates the severity of wildland fire potential using data on temperature, humidity, wind speed and rainfall, as well as fuel moisture and fuel type. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Updated frequently**<br>\n",
    "My long term vision is to create a product that can use daily (or more frequently updated) data and make next-day predictions on areas where wildfire is likely to spread. The temporal frequency of the data is particularly important given the rapidly-changing dynamics of wildfire behavior. Both GSMaP and GLDAS sources provide rich data on a three-hourly basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Publicly accessible**<br>\n",
    "Finally, in the hopes that the end product may be of use to others, I envision an easy-to-use tool, accessible by anyone, anywhere in the world. Towards this aim, I wanted data sources that were easy to access and publicly available. Google Earth Engine has transformed access to scientific and planetary datasets, making it an ideal platform to develop scripts and integrate them into a model."
