    "First, I developed a labeled dataset covering the time period and geography of interest. I used Google Earth Engine to download several satellite data products from NASA and JAXA, and used several geospatial and scientific Python packages to transform them into a labeled dataset consisting of four labels: active fire, burned area, land, and water. \n",
    "\n",
    "I scaled the data and applied methods to balance the classes. I randomly split the data into training (80% of the data) and test (20% of the data) sets, stratifying by labels. I then used ski-kit learn's multiclass classification algorithms to run logistic regression and random forest models on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I evaluated the model metrics (optimizing by balanced accuracy score) on both training and test data. After selecting the best-performing model, I ran the model on the entire dataset to visualize the mapped predictions compared to the actual predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty of room for improvement, particularly around feature selection, feature engineering, and modeling (including hyperparameter tuning). I summarized my thoughts on next steps in the final section of this notebook. "
